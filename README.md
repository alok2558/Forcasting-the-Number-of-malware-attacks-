# Forcasting-the-Number-of-malware-attacks-
This project involved training a deep learning model cosisting of Graph Neural Network, GRU and Attention mechanism to perform short term forecasting of cyber attacks.
The graph neural network and GRU layer handled the spatiotemporal dependencies present in the data set. 
We used CIDDS-001 dataset for the training and inference task.
Our model was able to achieve a coefficient of determinant of .87 for a 30 minutue forecasting task.

Enviornment required -  Python , pytorch, torch geometric , torch geometric temporal.
