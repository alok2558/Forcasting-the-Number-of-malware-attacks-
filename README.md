# Forcasting-the-Number-of-malware-attacks-
This project involved training a deep learning model cosisting of Principal neighborhood aggregation, GRU and Attention mechanism to perform short term forecasting of cyber attacks.
We used CIDDS-001 dataset for the training and inference task.
Our model was able to achieve a coefficient of determinant of .87 for a 30 minutue forecasting task
Enviornment required -  Python , pytorch, torch geometric , torch geometric temporal.
